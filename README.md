# Credit-card-fraud-detection
In today's digital age, fraudulent activities in financial transactions, particularly credit card fraud, pose significant challenges for both financial institutions and consumers. Detecting fraudulent transactions accurately and efficiently is paramount to mitigate financial losses and maintain trust in the banking system.

This project aims to develop a robust credit card fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a dataset containing credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate, the project explores various machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and shallow neural networks, to classify transactions accurately.

Key components of the project include:

Data preprocessing:- Cleaning and transforming the dataset to prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory data analysis: Understanding the characteristics and patterns of fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

Model selection and training: Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective model.

Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
